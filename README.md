First, download the dataset specified in DataPrepare.ipynb and follow the notebook to retreive the necessary subset of the data. Save it to 2Dreg_traintest, and verify the file structure is the same as in the sample.

From here, the registration and atlas training scripts can be run. The .ipynb file gives an example of the CLI command to run the script and save the data using the file structure here. After running these, any of the test scripts can similarly be run, and the pretrained registration atlas training can be run after registration training is done.

After a model is tested, prepare_figures.ipynb has examples of the figures made and how to load the data, which is automatically saved in the test scripts.

No data was uploaded, but the file structure mimics that which was used to produce and store data during training and testing
